# International NodeBots Chicago 2016 Workshop #

This is a simple repo just to test the particle photon and the weather shield that it came with for this workshop. If you would like to go over the set up for a particle photon, check out the slides included in the rep.

- hellw.js -- The hello world for the particle photon. Just getting its LED to blink to test that everything is set up correctly on your photon
- weather.js --- This file will allow you to get data from your weather shield! and print it in the console.
- myweather.js -- This file uses the data from the weather shield to check for humidity. If the humidity is over a certain value, an LED will blink as an "alarm"
